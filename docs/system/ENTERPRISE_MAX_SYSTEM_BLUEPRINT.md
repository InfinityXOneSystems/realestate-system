# INFINITY PRIME — MAXIMUM ENTERPRISE SYSTEM (FAANG-GRADE)

## CORE ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES
- Cloud-native (GCP first, portable)
- Event-driven (Pub/Sub everywhere)
- Contract-first (schemas + CI enforcement)
- Deterministic automation
- Auto-heal, auto-scale, auto-observe
- Cost-aware by default
- Open integration surface (APIs, webhooks, adapters)

---

## CONTROL PLANE (AUTONOMY + GOVERNANCE)
- Infinity Prime enforcement harness
- Risk-gated autonomy (SAFE / CAUTION / BLOCKED)
- Time & cycle budgets enforced
- Audit ledger for every run
- Kill-switches (service, crawler, agent, global)
- Canary deployments for crawlers & agents
- Drift detection + rollback

---

## GATEWAY (ENTERPRISE)
- API Gateway v2
- Auth: IAM + service-to-service identity
- Rate limiting per client/source
- Request signing
- Schema validation at ingress
- Webhooks + streaming endpoints
- Versioned APIs
- Multi-region failover

---

## ROUTER / POLICY ENGINE
- Intent-based routing
- Policy-as-code
- Source allowlist / denylist
- Cost-aware routing
- Priority queues (VIP clients)
- Circuit breakers

---

## PUB / SUB (EVENT BACKBONE)
- Google Pub/Sub as central spine
- Topics:
  - ingest.raw
  - ingest.validated
  - signals.detected
  - agents.tasks
  - alerts.critical
- Dead-letter queues
- Replayable events
- Exactly-once semantics where possible

---

## CRAWLER SYSTEM (HARDENED)
- Cloud Run Jobs + Scheduler
- Distributed crawler pools
- Adaptive throttling
- Robots + legal compliance
- Source health scoring
- Snapshot diff crawlers
- Change detection
- Geo-distributed crawling
- Cold start optimized images

---

## INGESTION & DATA PIPELINE
- Schema-first ingestion
- JSON Schema + versioning
- Deduplication & entity resolution
- Confidence scoring
- Provenance metadata
- Temporal normalization
- Geo-coding & enrichment (legal only)

---

## MEMORY SYSTEM
- Hot memory (Firestore / Redis)
- Warm memory (BigQuery)
- Cold memory (GCS)
- Entity-centric memory
- Time-series memory
- Event graph
- Versioned facts
- Retention & TTL policies

---

## AI / AGENT SYSTEM
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Role-based agents (Scout, Analyst, Verifier, Synthesizer)
- Tool-using agents
- Cross-source correlation
- Anomaly detection
- Trend acceleration models
- Explainability artifacts
- Drift detection
- Model fallback strategy

---

## CLIENT AUTOMATION (WORKSPACE BACKEND)
- Google Sheets (live data tables)
- Google Docs (auto-generated reports)
- Google Drive (artifact storage)
- Google Calendar (alerts & follow-ups)
- Google Tasks / Keep (action items)
- Gmail (AI email automation)
- Twilio AI Voice (inbound/outbound)
- CRM sync adapters

---

## COMMUNICATION AI
- Twilio AI phone agents
- Call recording + transcription
- Sentiment analysis
- Lead qualification
- Follow-up automation
- Email AI (SendGrid / Gmail)
- Personalized outreach at scale

---

## OBSERVABILITY
- Structured JSON logs
- Metrics (latency, cost, volume)
- Traces (end-to-end)
- Source freshness SLAs
- Alerting thresholds
- Incident runbooks
- Cost dashboards

---

## SECURITY / HARDNESS
- Least-privilege IAM
- Secret Manager everywhere
- No static keys
- VPC Service Controls
- Audit logging
- Data classification
- Jurisdiction controls
- Legal source registry

---

## COST OPTIMIZATION
- Serverless-first
- Scale-to-zero where possible
- Batch jobs for heavy compute
- Budget alerts
- Cost-aware scheduling
- Spot/preemptible where safe
- Model selection by cost/perf

---

## AUTO-HEAL / AUTO-FIX
- Health probes everywhere
- Auto-restart on failure
- Backoff & retry
- Circuit breakers
- Rollback on regression
- Self-verifying CI artifacts

---

## AUTO-LAUNCH / BOOTSTRAP
- AUTO_BOOT scripts
- Cloud Scheduler triggers
- Prime nightly supervisor
- On-commit CI enforcement
- On-deploy validation
- Zero-touch restart

---

## OPEN INTEGRATION SURFACE
- REST APIs
- Webhooks
- Pub/Sub subscriptions
- Client SDKs
- Partner adapters
- Marketplace-ready

---

## STATUS
This defines the MAXIMUM ENTERPRISE-GRADE SYSTEM
comparable to FAANG / OpenAI internal platforms,
optimized for:
- Efficiency
- Cost effectiveness
- Data leverage
- Autonomy without chaos
- Extreme extensibility
